    # Learning Paths

    Choose your journey based on your background and goals. Each path is designed to
    get you productive with MathHook as quickly as possible.

    ## Path 1: Python Data Scientist

    **Background**: Familiar with NumPy, SymPy, pandas
    **Goal**: Use MathHook for faster symbolic computation in Python
    **Time to Productivity**: 1-2 hours

    Learn Python API, performance comparison with SymPy, integration with data science
    stack, and when to use MathHook vs SymPy.

    ## Path 2: Node.js/TypeScript Developer

    **Background**: JavaScript/TypeScript web development
    **Goal**: Add symbolic math to web applications
    **Time to Productivity**: 2-3 hours

    Learn Node.js bindings, LaTeX parsing for web forms, web framework integration,
    and V8 optimization.

    ## Path 3: Rust Systems Programmer

    **Background**: Rust experience, need high-performance CAS
    **Goal**: Embed MathHook in Rust application or contribute to core
    **Time to Productivity**: 4-6 hours to mastery

    Learn architecture, memory layout, SIMD optimization, and custom extensions.

    ## Path 4: Mathematics Student/Educator

    **Background**: Calculus, linear algebra, abstract algebra knowledge
    **Goal**: Understand CAS internals, use for teaching, contribute
    **Time to Productivity**: 8-12 hours to contribution-ready

    Learn symbolic computation theory, algorithm implementation, and educational features.

    ## Path 5: Computational Scientist

    **Background**: MATLAB, Julia, scientific computing
    **Goal**: Fast symbolic preprocessing for numerical simulations
    **Time to Productivity**: 3-4 hours

    Learn symbolic matrix algebra, system solving, hybrid symbolic-numerical workflows,
    and code generation.

    ## Common Themes

    Essential concepts for all users:
    - Expressions are immutable (safe for concurrent use)
    - Canonical forms (x + y equals y + x)
    - Exact vs approximate arithmetic (rationals vs floats)
    - Error handling (domain errors, undefined operations)
