    # Thread Safety Guarantees

    This chapter covers internal implementation details of thread safety.

    ## Immutability

    All expressions are immutable after creation. This provides:

    - **Thread-safe sharing**: No data races
    - **Lock-free operations**: No synchronization overhead
    - **Predictable behavior**: No surprising mutations

    ## Parallel Processing

    Immutability enables efficient parallel processing:

    ```rust
    # extern crate mathhook_book;
    # use mathhook_book::mathhook;
    # use mathhook::prelude::*;
    let expressions = vec![/* many expressions */];
    let simplified = parallel_bulk_simplify(&expressions);
    ```

    ## Concurrency Patterns

    MathHook supports common concurrency patterns:

    - **Data parallelism**: Process multiple expressions in parallel
    - **Pipeline parallelism**: Chain operations across threads
    - **Work stealing**: Dynamic load balancing

    ## Safety Guarantees

    Rust's type system enforces:

    - **No data races**: Guaranteed at compile time
    - **No iterator invalidation**: Immutable collections
    - **No use-after-free**: Ownership system prevents
