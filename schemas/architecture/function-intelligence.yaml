    # Function Intelligence System

    This chapter covers internal implementation details of the function intelligence system.

    ## Function Registry

    MathHook maintains a global registry of mathematical functions with their properties:

    - **Differentiation rules**: How to differentiate each function
    - **Simplification patterns**: Known identities and simplifications
    - **Domain restrictions**: Valid input ranges
    - **Special values**: Function behavior at key points

    ## Automatic Simplification

    The function intelligence system enables automatic simplification based on:

    - Known identities (sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1)
    - Special values (sin(0) = 0, log(1) = 0)
    - Composition rules (sin(asin(x)) = x)

    ## Symbolic Differentiation

    Functions in the registry include differentiation rules:

    - Elementary functions (sin, cos, exp, log)
    - Hyperbolic functions (sinh, cosh, tanh)
    - Special functions (gamma, beta, erf)
