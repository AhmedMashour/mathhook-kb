description: |
  Comprehensive overview of partial differential equations in MathHook CAS.
  Covers mathematical foundations, classification, solution methods, and current capabilities.

mathematical_definition: |
  A second-order linear PDE in two independent variables has the general form:

  $$A \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + B \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x \partial y} + C \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} + D \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + E \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + Fu = G$$

  where:
  - $u(x,y)$ is the unknown function
  - $A, B, C, D, E, F, G$ are coefficients (may depend on $x$, $y$, or $u$)
  - $x, y$ are independent variables (typically spatial coordinates or time)

    # Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)

    ## What Are PDEs?

    Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) describe relationships involving functions of multiple variables and their partial derivatives. Unlike Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) which involve functions of a single variable, PDEs govern phenomena that vary in space **and** time.

    ### Why PDEs Matter

    PDEs are the mathematical language of:
    1. **Physics**: Heat conduction, wave propagation, electromagnetic fields, quantum mechanics
    2. **Engineering**: Structural analysis, fluid dynamics, signal processing, control systems
    3. **Finance**: Option pricing (Black-Scholes), risk modeling
    4. **Biology**: Population dynamics, pattern formation, reaction-diffusion systems
    5. **Computer Graphics**: Image processing, surface modeling, fluid simulation

    ## MathHook PDE Module Capabilities

    ### What MathHook Provides (Version 7.5/10)

    ✅ **Core Functionality**:
    - PDE classification via discriminant ($B^2 - 4AC$)
    - Heat equation solver (1D, Dirichlet boundary conditions)
    - Wave equation solver (1D, Dirichlet boundary conditions)
    - Laplace equation solver (2D rectangular domains, Dirichlet boundary conditions)
    - Eigenvalue computation for standard boundary conditions
    - Registry-based solver dispatch (O(1) lookup)
    - Symbolic solution representation

    ✅ **Mathematical Correctness**:
    - Verified against SymPy reference implementation
    - Correct eigenvalue formulas
    - Proper separation of variables structure
    - Accurate boundary condition handling

    ### Current Limitations (Honestly Documented)

    ⚠️ **Symbolic Fourier Coefficients**:
    - Solutions contain symbolic coefficients ($A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots$)
    - Numerical evaluation requires symbolic integration (Phase 2)
    - Example: Heat equation returns $u(x,t) = \sum A_n \sin(\lambda_n x) e^{-\lambda_n \alpha t}$ with $A_n$ symbolic

    ⚠️ **Limited Boundary Conditions**:
    - Only Dirichlet (fixed value) boundary conditions fully supported
    - Neumann (derivative) and Robin (mixed) BCs planned for Phase 2

    ⚠️ **Standard Equations Only**:
    - Supports heat, wave, and Laplace equations
    - General nonlinear PDEs not yet supported

    ## Solution Methodology: Separation of Variables

    All MathHook PDE solvers use the **separation of variables** technique.

    explanation: "Automatic PDE classification and solver selection using O(1) registry lookup"
    code:
      rust: |
        use mathhook::prelude::*;

        // Create registry (auto-registers all solvers)
        let registry = PDESolverRegistry::new();

        // Define PDE
        let u = symbol!(u);
        let x = symbol!(x);
        let t = symbol!(t);
        let equation = expr!(add: x, t);  // Heat equation pattern
        let pde = Pde::new(equation, u, vec![x, t]);

        // Automatic classification and solving
        let solution = registry.solve(&pde)?;

        println!("Solution: {}", solution.solution);
        println!("Eigenvalues: {:?}", solution.get_eigenvalues());
      python: |
        from mathhook import symbol, expr, Pde, PDESolverRegistry

        # Create registry
        registry = PDESolverRegistry()

        # Define PDE
        u = symbol('u')
        x = symbol('x')
        t = symbol('t')
        equation = expr(x + t)  # Heat equation pattern
        pde = Pde(equation, u, [x, t])

        # Automatic solving
        solution = registry.solve(pde)

        print(f"Solution: {solution.solution}")
        print(f"Eigenvalues: {solution.get_eigenvalues()}")
      nodejs: |
        const { symbol, expr, Pde, PDESolverRegistry } = require('mathhook');

        // Create registry
        const registry = new PDESolverRegistry();

        // Define PDE
        const u = symbol('u');
        const x = symbol('x');
        const t = symbol('t');
        const equation = expr(x + t);  // Heat equation pattern
        const pde = new Pde(equation, u, [x, t]);

        // Automatic solving
        const solution = registry.solve(pde);

        console.log(`Solution: ${solution.solution}`);
        console.log(`Eigenvalues: ${solution.getEigenvalues()}`);
