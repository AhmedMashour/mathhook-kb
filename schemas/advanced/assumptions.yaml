    # Symbolic Assumptions

    Assumptions allow you to declare mathematical properties about symbols
    (positive, real, integer, etc.) to guide MathHook's symbolic engine toward
    more accurate simplifications and solutions.

    ## Why Assumptions Matter

    Without assumptions, MathHook treats all symbols as arbitrary complex numbers,
    leading to overly conservative results. With assumptions:
    - √(x²) can simplify to |x| (real assumption) or x (positive assumption)
    - Inequalities can be solved symbolically
    - Domain restrictions are enforced

    ## Current Status

    **Planned Feature**: Full assumption system is under development.

    ## Expected API (Future)

    ```rust
    let x = symbol!(x).assume_positive();
    let y = symbol!(y).assume_real();
    let n = symbol!(n).assume_integer();

    let expr = expr!(sqrt(x^2));
    // With x > 0: simplifies to x
    // Without: stays as sqrt(x^2) or becomes |x|
    ```

    ## Assumption Types (Planned)

    - **Positivity**: x > 0, x ≥ 0, x < 0, x ≤ 0
    - **Reality**: x ∈ ℝ (real numbers)
    - **Integer**: n ∈ ℤ
    - **Rational**: q ∈ ℚ
    - **Natural**: n ∈ ℕ (positive integers)
    - **Finiteness**: x is finite (not infinity)
    - **Primality**: p is prime (for number theory)

    ## Use Cases

    ### Simplification
    With assumptions, expressions simplify more aggressively:
    - √(x²) → x (if x > 0)
    - |x| → x (if x > 0)
    - x/x → 1 (if x ≠ 0)

    ### Solving
    Inequalities and conditional solutions:
    - Solve x² > 4 given x > 0 → x > 2
    - Solve log(x) = 2 → x = e² (with x > 0 automatic)

    ### Integration
    Domain restrictions for improper integrals:
    - ∫₀^∞ e^(-ax) dx requires a > 0

    ### Series Expansion
    Convergence conditions:
    - Taylor series valid for |x| < R

    ## Relation to SymPy/SageMath

    MathHook's assumption system will follow similar patterns to SymPy's
    `assume()` API but integrated directly into the symbol creation macros.
