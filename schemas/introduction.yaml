    # Introduction

    Welcome to the MathHook documentation! MathHook is a high-performance educational computer algebra system (CAS) written in Rust, designed to combine mathematical correctness with exceptional performance.

    ## What is MathHook?

    MathHook is a symbolic mathematics engine that can:

    - **Parse** mathematical expressions from multiple formats (LaTeX, Wolfram Language, standard notation)
    - **Simplify** algebraic expressions using canonical forms and mathematical identities
    - **Differentiate** and **integrate** expressions symbolically
    - **Solve** equations and systems of equations
    - **Manipulate** matrices with full linear algebra support
    - **Explain** mathematical operations step-by-step for educational purposes

    ## Why MathHook?

    ### Performance-First Design

    MathHook is built from the ground up for speed:

    - **32-byte expression representation** fits perfectly in CPU cache lines
    - **SIMD operations** for vectorized arithmetic (2-4x speedup)
    - **Zero-copy parsing** directly constructs AST without intermediate allocations
    - **Thread-safe immutable expressions** enable parallel processing
    - **10-100x faster** than SymPy for common operations

    ### Mathematical Correctness

    Every operation in MathHook is designed to be mathematically correct:

    - Exact rational arithmetic (never loses precision)
    - Proper domain handling (sqrt, log, division by zero)
    - Canonical forms for reliable equality checking
    - Validated against SymPy

    ### Educational Focus

    MathHook provides step-by-step explanations for all mathematical operations, making it ideal for:

    - Educational software
    - Mathematics learning platforms
    - Interactive mathematics tools
    - Automated tutoring systems

    ### Multi-Language Support

    MathHook provides first-class bindings for:

    - **Rust** (native API with ergonomic macros)
    - **Python** (via PyO3)
    - **Node.js/TypeScript** (via NAPI-RS)
    - **WebAssembly** (coming soon)

    ## Key Features

    ### Expression Building

    Create mathematical expressions naturally using the `expr!` and `symbol!` macros.

    ### Symbolic Computation

    Perform algebraic manipulations symbolically:
    - Simplification
    - Expansion
    - Factorization

    ### Calculus Operations

    Compute derivatives and integrals symbolically.

    ### Equation Solving

    Solve equations and systems of equations.

    ### Matrix Operations

    Full linear algebra support with symbolic and numeric matrices.

    ## Architecture

    MathHook is organized as a multi-crate workspace:

    - **mathhook-core**: Core mathematical engine (pure Rust)
    - **mathhook**: High-level API with ergonomic macros
    - **mathhook-python**: Python bindings
    - **mathhook-node**: Node.js/TypeScript bindings
    - **mathhook-benchmarks**: Performance benchmarking suite

    ## Design Principles

    MathHook follows five core principles (in priority order):

    1. **Mathematical Correctness First**: Every operation must be mathematically correct
    2. **Performance**: Cache-friendly data structures, SIMD operations, parallel processing
    3. **Ergonomic API**: Macros and operator overloading for natural expression
    4. **Educational Value**: Step-by-step explanations for all operations
    5. **Multi-Language**: First-class bindings for Python, Node.js, and WebAssembly
