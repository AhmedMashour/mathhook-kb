    ## 1. Executive Summary

    ### Current Reality
    - **127 mathematical operations** audited
    - **Only 15 (12%)** have step-by-step educational support
    - **103 (81%)** have ZERO educational integration
    - **9 (7%)** have partial integration

    ### Target State
    - **95%+ operations** with step-by-step explanations
    - **Unified educational trait pattern** across all operations
    - **Public APIs** for all educational functionality
    - **Comprehensive test coverage** for educational outputs

    ### Critical Path
    1. Export hidden functionality (5 minutes, massive impact)
    2. Wire existing educational modules to public API (hours each)
    3. Implement missing `_with_steps` methods (follow patterns)
    4. Create educational module for matrices (new but straightforward)

key_findings:
  - "127 mathematical operations audited - only 15 (12%) have educational support"
  - "103 operations (81%) have ZERO educational integration"
  - "Hidden gems: DerivativeWithSteps trait exists but not exported (5 min fix)"
  - "6 integration explain_* functions exist but not public"
  - "Educational infrastructure already in place (5 layers)"
  - "Simplification system (10 ops) has 0% coverage - CRITICAL gap"
  - "Matrix operations (14 ops) has 0% coverage - blocks linear algebra education"
  - "ODE module with_steps pattern works - use as template"

action_items:
  - "Phase 1 (4-5 hrs): Export DerivativeWithSteps, integration/limit explain functions, create simplify_with_steps wrapper"
  - "Phase 2 (15-20 hrs): Implement integrate_with_steps(), add 2nd order ODE steps, create simplification step tracing"
  - "Phase 3 (40-50 hrs): Matrix educational module (15-20 hrs), factorization steps (8-10 hrs), series explanations (6-8 hrs)"
  - "Phase 4 (35-45 hrs): Unify trait patterns, create step-by-step framework, systematic testing and documentation"
  - "Task 1.1: Export DerivativeWithSteps in lib.rs (5 min, HIGH impact)"
  - "Task 1.2: Make explain_* functions public in integrals/educational.rs (5 min)"
  - "Task 1.4: Create simplify_with_steps wrapper (30-60 min, CRITICAL impact)"
  - "Task 2.1: Implement integrate_with_steps() trait (4-6 hours)"
  - "Task 3.1: Create matrix operations educational module (15-20 hours for 14 operations)"
