  - title: "Simple Exponential Growth"
    explanation: |
      The simplest separable ODE models exponential growth: dy/dx = y.
      This can be separated as dy/y = dx, integrating gives ln|y| = x + C,
      which simplifies to y = Ce^x. This models population growth, radioactive
      decay (with negative constant), and compound interest.
    code:
      rust: |
        use mathhook_core::{symbol, expr};
        use mathhook_core::ode::SeparableODESolver;

        let x = symbol!(x);
        let y = symbol!(y);

        // dy/dx = y (exponential growth)
        let rhs = expr!(y);
        let solver = SeparableODESolver::new();

        // General solution: y = C*e^x
        let solution = solver.solve(&rhs, &y, &x, None)?;
        println!("General solution: {}", solution);

        // Particular solution with y(0) = 3
        let ic = (expr!(0), expr!(3));
        let particular = solver.solve(&rhs, &y, &x, Some(ic))?;
        println!("Particular solution: {}", particular); // y = 3*e^x

  - title: "Logistic Growth Model"
    explanation: |
      The logistic equation dy/dx = y(1-y) models population growth with carrying
      capacity. Separating variables: dy/(y(1-y)) = dx. Using partial fractions:
      (1/y + 1/(1-y))dy = dx. Integrating: ln|y/(1-y)| = x + C.
      Solving for y: y = 1/(1 + Ce^(-x)). This S-curve is fundamental in ecology,
      epidemiology, and marketing.
    code:
      rust: |
        use mathhook_core::{symbol, expr};
        use mathhook_core::ode::SeparableODESolver;

        let x = symbol!(x);
        let y = symbol!(y);

        // dy/dx = y(1-y) (logistic growth)
        let rhs = expr!(y * (1 - y));
        let solver = SeparableODESolver::new();

        // General solution: y = 1/(1 + C*e^(-x))
        let solution = solver.solve(&rhs, &y, &x, None)?;

        // With y(0) = 0.1 (10% initial population)
        let ic = (expr!(0), expr!(0.1));
        let particular = solver.solve(&rhs, &y, &x, Some(ic))?;
        println!("{}", particular); // y = 1/(1 + 9*e^(-x))

  - title: "Newton's Law of Cooling"
    explanation: |
      Temperature change follows dT/dt = k(T - T_ambient). For T_ambient = 20°C,
      this becomes dT/dt = k(T - 20). Separating: dT/(T-20) = k*dt.
      Integrating: ln|T-20| = kt + C, so T = 20 + Ce^(kt). If T(0) = 100°C and
      k = -0.05, then T = 20 + 80*e^(-0.05t). This models coffee cooling,
      forensic time-of-death estimation, and HVAC systems.
    code:
      rust: |
        use mathhook_core::{symbol, expr};
        use mathhook_core::ode::SeparableODESolver;

        let k = expr!(-0.05);

      Imagine you're a detective investigating a crime scene, and you find a body.
      The coroner needs to estimate time of death. How? By measuring body temperature
      and using Newton's Law of Cooling—a separable differential equation. From modeling
      population growth to predicting how fast your coffee cools, separable ODEs are
      everywhere in nature and engineering.

    motivation: |
      Separable differential equations are the most fundamental class of solvable ODEs,
      accounting for approximately 30% of all first-order ODE problems. They're called
      "separable" because you can algebraically separate the variables (x and y) onto
      different sides of the equation, making them solvable by direct integration—no
      fancy techniques needed.

      - "How to recognize separable ODEs: dy/dx = g(x)h(y)"
      - "The separation of variables technique"
      - "How to apply initial conditions for particular solutions"

  sections:
    - title: "What Makes an ODE Separable?"
      content: |
        A first-order ODE is **separable** if it can be written in the form:

        $$\\frac{dy}{dx} = g(x)h(y)$$

        Notice that the right-hand side factors into a function of $x$ multiplied by
        a function of $y$. This special structure allows us to algebraically manipulate
        the equation to get all $y$ terms on one side and all $x$ terms on the other.

        ### Recognition Patterns

        **Separable:**
        - $dy/dx = xy$ (factors as $x \\cdot y$)
        - $dy/dx = e^{x+y} = e^x \\cdot e^y$ (exponential property)
        - $dy/dx = \\sin(x)\\cos(y)$ (product of functions)

        **NOT Separable:**
        - $dy/dx = x + y$ (sum, not product)
        - $dy/dx = xy + y^2$ (can't factor into g(x)h(y))
        - $dy/dx = \\sin(xy)$ (mixed argument)

        ### The Key Insight

        If we can write $dy/dx = g(x)h(y)$, then we can rearrange:

        $$\\frac{dy}{h(y)} = g(x)dx$$

        Now both sides are ready to integrate independently!

    - title: "The Separation of Variables Method"
      content: |
        The solution process has four clear steps:

        ### Step 1: Verify Separability

        Check if the equation can be factored as $dy/dx = g(x)h(y)$.

        ### Step 2: Separate Variables

        Rearrange to get all $y$ terms (including $dy$) on one side and all $x$ terms
        (including $dx$) on the other:

        $$\\frac{dy}{h(y)} = g(x)dx$$

        ### Step 3: Integrate Both Sides

        $$\\int \\frac{dy}{h(y)} = \\int g(x)dx + C$$

        The constant of integration $C$ appears on the right side (convention).

        ### Step 4: Solve for y (if possible)

        Try to solve algebraically for $y$ as an explicit function of $x$. Sometimes
        this isn't possible, and we get an **implicit solution** instead (which is
        still valid!).

        ### Example: dy/dx = xy

        1. **Verify:** $g(x) = x$, $h(y) = y$ ✓
        2. **Separate:** $dy/y = x\\,dx$
        3. **Integrate:** $\\ln|y| = x^2/2 + C$
        4. **Solve:** $y = Ae^{x^2/2}$ (where $A = \\pm e^C$)

    - title: "Initial Value Problems"
      content: |
        An **initial condition** $y(x_0) = y_0$ allows us to find the particular
        solution (a specific curve) rather than the general solution (a family of curves).

        ### Method

        1. Find the general solution with constant $C$
        2. Substitute the initial condition: $y(x_0) = y_0$
        3. Solve for $C$
        4. Write the particular solution

        ### Example: Exponential Growth with Initial Population

        **Problem:** $dy/dx = 0.5y$, $y(0) = 100$

        **General solution:**
        - Separate: $dy/y = 0.5\\,dx$
        - Integrate: $\\ln|y| = 0.5x + C$
        - Solve: $y = Ae^{0.5x}$

        **Apply initial condition:**
        - $y(0) = 100 \\Rightarrow Ae^0 = A = 100$

        **Particular solution:** $y = 100e^{0.5x}$

        This represents a population that doubles every $\\ln(2)/0.5 \\approx 1.386$ time units.

        - Solution: $P(t) = P_0 e^{rt}$
        - Models: bacteria, investments, viral videos

        **Logistic Growth:** $dP/dt = rP(1 - P/K)$
        - Solution: $P(t) = K/(1 + Ae^{-rt})$
        - Models: species with limited resources, product adoption

        ### Physics

    - type: "note"
      title: "Mathematical Rigor: Why Does This Work?"
      content: |
        When we write $dy/dx = g(x)h(y)$ and rearrange to $\\frac{dy}{h(y)} = g(x)dx$,
        we're treating $dy$ and $dx$ as differentials (infinitesimals). While this
        notation is intuitive, the rigorous justification uses the **chain rule**:

        If $y = y(x)$, then $dy = y'(x)dx$ by definition of the differential. So:

        $$\\frac{dy}{h(y)} = \\frac{y'(x)dx}{h(y(x))} = \\frac{g(x)h(y(x))dx}{h(y(x))} = g(x)dx$$

        Integrating both sides with respect to their respective variables is valid
        by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

    - type: "warning"
      title: "Common Pitfall: Losing Solutions"
      content: |
        ⚠️ **Warning:** When dividing by $h(y)$, we might lose **singular solutions**!

        Example: $dy/dx = y^2$
        - Separating: $dy/y^2 = dx$ (we divided by $y^2$)
        - Integrating: $-1/y = x + C$
        - Solution: $y = -1/(x+C)$

        **But wait!** What if $y = 0$? Let's check:
        - $dy/dx = 0^2 = 0$ ✓ (satisfies the original equation!)
        - This is a **singular solution** we lost by dividing by $y^2$

        **Best practice:** Always check if $h(y) = 0$ gives a solution!

    - type: "performance"
      title: "Computational Complexity"
      content: |
        MathHook's separable ODE solver has the following complexity:

        **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the complexity of symbolic integration
        - Pattern matching to verify separability: $O(m)$ for expression size $m$
        - Two symbolic integrations: $O(n)$ each
        - Algebraic manipulation to solve for $y$: $O(m)$

        **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing intermediate expressions

        **Comparison to numerical methods:**
        - Symbolic: One-time $O(n)$, then instant evaluation
        - Numerical (Runge-Kutta): $O(k)$ per evaluation, where $k$ is number of steps

        For repeated evaluations, symbolic wins. For one-off evaluations or
        non-separable equations, numerical may be faster.

  conclusion:
    summary: |
      Separable differential equations are the foundation of ODE solving. Their
      simple form—factorable into $g(x)h(y)$—allows us to use basic integration
      rather than advanced techniques. From exponential growth to Newton's cooling,
      separable ODEs model fundamental processes in nature and engineering.

      Key takeaways:
      - **Recognition:** Can you factor the RHS as $g(x)h(y)$?
      - **Method:** Separate variables, integrate both sides
      - **Initial conditions:** Find the particular solution by substituting $y(x_0) = y_0$
      - **Watch out:** Don't lose singular solutions when dividing by $h(y)$

        - title: "Existence and Uniqueness Theorem"
          content: |
            The **Picard-Lindelöf theorem** guarantees a unique solution to
            $dy/dx = f(x,y)$ with $y(x_0) = y_0$ if $f$ is continuous and
            Lipschitz continuous in $y$ near $(x_0, y_0)$.

            For separable equations $dy/dx = g(x)h(y)$:
            - **Existence:** Guaranteed if $g(x)$ and $h(y)$ are continuous
            - **Uniqueness:** Guaranteed except where $h(y_0) = 0$

            This explains why singular solutions (where $h(y) = 0$) can appear!

        - title: "Direction Fields and Solution Curves"
          content: |
            A **direction field** (slope field) visualizes the ODE by drawing
            small line segments with slope $f(x,y)$ at each point $(x,y)$.

            For separable equations, the direction field has special structure:
            - Along lines where $h(y) = 0$, slopes are zero (horizontal)
            - Along lines where $g(x) = 0$, slopes are zero (vertical)
            - Solution curves follow the flow of the direction field

            This geometric perspective helps understand singular solutions and
            the qualitative behavior without solving explicitly.

      implementation_notes: |
        MathHook's implementation uses a pattern matching system to detect
        separability. The key challenge is factoring arbitrary expressions
        into $g(x)h(y)$ form. Current approach:

        1. Extract all factors from the RHS expression
        2. Classify each factor as "depends on x only", "depends on y only", or "mixed"
        3. If any factor is "mixed", equation is not separable
        4. Otherwise, group x-factors into g(x) and y-factors into h(y)

        This is $O(m)$ for expression size $m$, using a single traversal.

      complexity_analysis: |
        **Separability Check:** $O(m)$ for expression size $m$
        **Variable Separation:** $O(m)$ algebraic manipulation
        **Integration (symbolic):** $O(n \\log n)$ to $O(n^2)$ depending on integrand
        **Solving for y:** $O(m)$ to $O(m^2)$ depending on implicit complexity
        **Total:** Dominated by integration, typically $O(n \\log n)$ to $O(n^2)$

        **Optimizations:**
        - Cache integration results for common patterns (e.g., $\\int e^x dx$)
        - Use lookup table for elementary integrals
        - Parallel integration of both sides (independent operations)
