## Executive Summary

This document consolidates findings from 6 specialized review agents examining type inference/dispatch, performance, abstraction quality, and educational stepping coverage across all MathHook modules.

### Overall Assessment

| Module | Type Dispatch | Performance | Abstraction | Educational | Overall |
|--------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Matrices** | 4.5/5 | 3.5/5 | 4/5 | 1.5/5 | 4/5 |
| **Solvers** | 4.5/5 | 4/5 | 4/5 | 4.5/5 | 4.2/5 |
| **ODE** | 4.5/5 | 4/5 | 4.5/5 | 4.5/5 | 4.6/5 |
| **PDE** | 2/5 | 3/5 | 3.5/5 | 1/5 | 2.4/5 |
| **Pattern Matching** | 4/5 | 3.5/5 | 4/5 | 0/5 | 3.4/5 |
| **Calculus** | 4/5 | 3.5/5 | 4/5 | 3.5/5 | 4.2/5 |
| **Function Dispatch** | 4/5 | 5/5 | 3/5 | 2/5 | 3.5/5 |

**Key Findings:**
- ODE module is production-ready with excellent architecture (4.6/5)
- PDE module has critical implementation gaps - NOT production-ready (2.4/5)
- Educational coverage varies dramatically (0% to 100% by module)
- Function dispatch has architectural split (registry vs hardcoded)
- Pattern matching API is hidden despite being complete
