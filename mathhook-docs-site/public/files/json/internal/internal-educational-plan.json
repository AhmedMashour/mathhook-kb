Executive Summary\n\n### Current Reality\n- **127 mathematical operations** audited\n- **Only 15 (12%)** have step-by-step educational support\n- **103 (81%)** have ZERO educational integration\n- **9 (7%)** have partial integration\n\n### Target State\n- **95%+ operations** with step-by-step explanations\n- **Unified educational trait pattern** across all operations\n- **Public APIs** for all educational functionality\n- **Comprehensive test coverage** for educational outputs\n\n### Critical Path\n1. Export hidden functionality (5 minutes, massive impact)\n2. Wire existing educational modules to public API (hours each)\n3. Implement missing `_with_steps` methods (follow patterns)\n4. Create educational module for matrices (new but straightforward)\n"
