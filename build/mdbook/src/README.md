Welcome to the MathHook documentation! This comprehensive guide covers all symbolic mathematics operations available in the MathHook library.

## Quick Navigation

Use the sidebar to browse topics by category:

- **Algebra** - Simplification, solving, matrices, polynomials
- **Calculus** - Derivatives, integrals, limits, series
- **ODE** - Ordinary differential equations and solving methods
- **PDE** - Partial differential equations
- **Advanced** - Complex numbers, assumptions, special functions
- **Core** - Expression building, symbols, evaluation

## Code Examples

Every topic includes working code examples in three languages:

```rust
// Rust
let x = symbol!(x);
let f = expr!(x^2 + 2*x + 1);
let df = f.derivative(&x);
```

```python
# Python
x = symbol('x')
f = x**2 + 2*x + 1
df = f.diff(x)
```

```javascript
// JavaScript
const x = symbol('x');
const f = expr('x^2 + 2*x + 1');
const df = f.derivative(x);
```
