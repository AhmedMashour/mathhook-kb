## What is the Risch Algorithm?

The **Risch algorithm** (pronounced "rish") is a complete decision procedure for symbolic integration of elementary functions. Developed by Robert Risch in 1969-1970, it can:

1. **Compute antiderivatives** when they exist in elementary form
2. **Prove impossibility** when no elementary antiderivative exists

### Elementary Functions

An **elementary function** is built from:
- Rational functions (polynomials and their quotients)
- Exponential functions (e^x, a^x)
- Logarithmic functions (ln(x), log(x))
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, etc.)
- Inverse trigonometric functions (arcsin, arctan, etc.)
- Algebraic functions (roots like sqrt(x))

...using a finite number of:
- Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
- Compositions (f(g(x)))

### What Makes Risch Special?

**Before Risch**: Integration was art + pattern matching
- No systematic approach
- Couldn't prove when integral was impossible
- Relied on human intuition and lookup tables

**After Risch**: Integration became algorithmic
- Deterministic procedure (polynomial time complexity)
- Provably correct (mathematical proof of correctness)
- Complete (decides all elementary integral questions)

---

## Why It Matters

### Completeness Guarantee

The Risch algorithm provides a **completeness guarantee**:

> For any elementary function f(x), the Risch algorithm will either:
> 1. Compute an elementary antiderivative F(x) such that F'(x) = f(x), OR
> 2. Prove that no such F(x) exists in elementary functions

This is revolutionary. Without Risch, you might spend hours trying to integrate something impossible.

### Real-World Impact

**Computer Algebra Systems**:
- SymPy (Python): Full Risch implementation
- Mathematica: Proprietary Risch variant
- Maple: Risch-based integration
- MathHook: Basic Risch implementation (exponential/logarithmic cases)

**Applications**:
- Symbolic mathematics research
- Engineering calculations
- Physics simulations
- Educational tools

**Example Why It Matters**:
```
∫e^(-x^2) dx  # Gaussian integral

Without Risch: Try for hours, never certain if you're missing a trick
With Risch: Proves in milliseconds that no elementary form exists
            Result: erf(x) (error function, non-elementary)
```

## Algorithm Phases

The Risch algorithm has several phases, each handling a specific aspect of the integration problem.

### Phase 1: Differential Extension Tower

**Purpose**: Represent f(x) as a rational function over a tower of extensions

A **differential extension** is a structure (K, ∂) where:
- K is a field (rational functions over extensions)
- ∂ is a derivation (differentiation operation)

**Example**:
```
f(x) = e^x / (e^x + 1)

Extension tower:
  Base: Q(x)                   [rationals in x]
  Level 1: Q(x, t₁) where t₁ = e^x, ∂t₁ = t₁

Now f(x) = t₁ / (t₁ + 1) ∈ Q(x, t₁)
```

**Why This Helps**:
- Converts transcendental problem to algebraic one
- Standard techniques work on rational functions
- Systematic handling of exponentials and logarithms

**MathHook Implementation**:
```rust
pub struct DifferentialExtension {
    pub base_field: Symbol,           // x
    pub extensions: Vec<Extension>,   // [e^x, ln(x), ...]
    pub derivations: Vec<Expression>, // [e^x, 1/x, ...]
}

pub enum Extension {
    Exponential(Expression), // t = e^g(x)
    Logarithmic(Expression), // t = ln(g(x))
    Algebraic(Expression),   // Future: t^n = g(x)
}
```

### Phase 2: Hermite Reduction

**Purpose**: Split rational part into polynomial part + reduced rational part

The **Hermite reduction** theorem states:

> Any rational function R(x) can be written as:
> R(x) = P(x) + S(x) + ∫T(x) dx
>
> Where:
> - P(x) is a polynomial (integrates trivially)
> - S(x) is a simple rational function (no repeated denominator factors)
> - T(x) is a reduced rational function (denominator is squarefree)

**Why This Helps**:
- Polynomial integration is trivial: ∫x^n dx = x^(n+1)/(n+1)
- Reduced forms integrate using logarithmic formulas
- Eliminates repeated factors that complicate integration

**Example**:
```
∫1/(x^2*(x+1)) dx

Hermite reduction:
  S(x) = -1/x           [simple part from repeated factor]
  T(x) = 1/(x*(x+1))    [reduced part, squarefree denominator]

Result:
  ∫1/(x^2*(x+1)) dx = -1/x + ∫1/(x*(x+1)) dx
                     = -1/x + ln|x| - ln|x+1| + C
```

**MathHook Implementation**:
```rust
pub fn hermite_reduce(
    rational: &RationalFunction,
    extension: &DifferentialExtension
) -> (Expression, Expression, Expression) {
    // Returns: (polynomial_part, simple_part, reduced_part)
}
```

### Phase 3: Risch Differential Equation (RDE)

**Purpose**: Solve equations of the form ∂y + f*y = g for y

The **Risch Differential Equation** (RDE) is:

> ∂y + f*y = g
>
> Find y such that the equation holds, or prove none exists

**Why This Appears**:
- Integration in extension fields reduces to solving RDEs
- Exponential integrals: ∫g*e^f dx corresponds to RDE with f = ∂f/f
- Logarithmic integrals: Different RDE variant

**Solution Methods**:
1. Polynomial ansatz (assume y is polynomial, solve for coefficients)
2. Rational function ansatz (for more complex cases)
3. Degree bounds (limit search space using theoretical bounds)

**Example**:
```
∫e^x/(e^x+1) dx

In extension Q(x, t₁) where t₁ = e^x:
  Need to integrate f = t₁/(t₁+1)

RDE formulation:
  ∂y + (∂t₁/t₁)*y = t₁/(t₁+1)
  ∂y + y = t₁/(t₁+1)

Solution:
  y = ln(t₁+1) = ln(e^x+1)
```

**MathHook Implementation**:
```rust
pub fn solve_rde(
    f: &Expression,
    g: &Expression,
    extension: &DifferentialExtension
) -> Option<Expression> {
    // Solve ∂y + f*y = g
}
```

### Phase 4: Exponential Case Integration

**Purpose**: Integrate expressions with exponential extensions

**Pattern**: ∫P(x)*e^(Q(x)) dx where P, Q are rational

**Algorithm**:
1. Build extension tower with t = e^(Q(x))
2. Express integrand as rational in t
3. Apply Hermite reduction
4. Solve RDE for logarithmic part
5. Combine results

**Examples**:
```
∫x*e^(x^2) dx
  u = x^2, t = e^u
  = (1/2)∫t dt  [after substitution]
  = (1/2)t + C
  = (1/2)e^(x^2) + C

∫e^x/(e^x+1) dx
  t = e^x
  = ∫t/(t+1) dt
  = ln(t+1) + C  [logarithmic part via RDE]
  = ln(e^x+1) + C
```

**MathHook Implementation**:
```rust
pub fn integrate_exponential_case(
    expr: &Expression,
    extension: &DifferentialExtension
) -> Option<Expression>
```

### Phase 5: Logarithmic Case Integration

**Purpose**: Integrate expressions with logarithmic extensions

**Pattern**: ∫P(x, ln(Q(x))) dx where P is rational in both arguments

**Algorithm**:
1. Build extension tower with t = ln(Q(x))
2. Express integrand as rational in x and t
3. Integrate rational part (partial fractions)
4. Handle logarithmic terms via integration by parts

**Examples**:
```
∫ln(x)/x dx
  t = ln(x), ∂t = 1/x
  = ∫t*(1/x) dx
  = ∫t*∂t
  = t^2/2 + C
  = (ln(x))^2/2 + C

∫1/(x*ln(x)) dx
  t = ln(x), ∂t = 1/x
  = ∫(1/t)*∂t
  = ln|t| + C
  = ln|ln(x)| + C
```

**MathHook Implementation**:
```rust
pub fn integrate_logarithmic_case(
    expr: &Expression,
    extension: &DifferentialExtension
) -> Option<Expression>
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Exponential Rational

**Integral**: ∫e^x/(e^x+1) dx

**Step 1**: Build extension
```
Base: Q(x)
Extension: t = e^x, ∂t = e^x = t
Integrand: f = t/(t+1) ∈ Q(x, t)
```

**Step 2**: Hermite reduction
```
f = t/(t+1) is already reduced (denominator squarefree)
Polynomial part: 0
Simple part: 0
Reduced part: t/(t+1)
```

**Step 3**: RDE
```
Need: ∫t/(t+1) dt

Partial fractions: t/(t+1) = 1 - 1/(t+1)

∫1 dt = t
∫1/(t+1) dt = ln|t+1|  [RDE solution]

Result: t - ln|t+1| = e^x - ln|e^x+1|
```

**Step 4**: Simplify
```
e^x - ln|e^x+1| = e^x - ln(e^x+1)  [e^x+1 always positive]
```

**MathHook Output**: `ln(e^x+1) + C`

### Example 2: Logarithmic Composition

**Integral**: ∫1/(x*ln(x)) dx

**Step 1**: Build extension
```
Base: Q(x)
Extension: t = ln(x), ∂t = 1/x
Integrand: f = 1/(x*t) = (1/x)*(1/t)
```

**Step 2**: Hermite reduction
```
f = 1/(x*t) is rational in x and t
Already reduced form
```

**Step 3**: Integrate
```
∫(1/x)*(1/t) dx

Observe: ∂t = 1/x, so dx = x*dt

∫(1/x)*(1/t)*x*dt = ∫(1/t) dt = ln|t| + C
```

**Step 4**: Back-substitute
```
ln|t| + C = ln|ln(x)| + C
```

**MathHook Output**: `ln|ln(x)| + C`

### Example 3: Mixed Exponential and Polynomial

**Integral**: ∫x*e^(x^2) dx

**Step 1**: Recognize composition (u-substitution would also work)
```
u = x^2, ∂u = 2x dx
=> x dx = (1/2) du
```

**Step 2**: Build extension
```
Base: Q(u)
Extension: t = e^u, ∂t = e^u = t
Integrand (after substitution): (1/2)*t
```

**Step 3**: Integrate
```
(1/2)∫t dt = (1/2)*t + C
```

**Step 4**: Back-substitute
```
(1/2)*e^u + C = (1/2)*e^(x^2) + C
```

**MathHook Output**: `(1/2)*e^(x^2) + C`

## Non-Elementary Detection

One of Risch's most powerful features: **proving impossibility**.

### How It Works

The Risch algorithm can prove an integral has no elementary antiderivative by:

1. **Degree Bounds**: Computing maximum possible degree of antiderivative
2. **Ansatz Failure**: Showing no polynomial/rational solution exists to RDE
3. **Structure Theorem**: Using theorems about elementary function structure

If all solution methods fail after exhaustive search within bounds, the integral is **provably non-elementary**.

### Classic Non-Elementary Integrals

**Error Function**:
```
∫e^(-x^2) dx

Risch analysis:
  Extension: t = e^(-x^2), ∂t = -2x*t
  RDE: ∂y - 2x*y = 1 (no elementary solution)

Result: Not elementary
Actual: (√π/2)*erf(x) + C  [erf is non-elementary]
```

**Sine Integral**:
```
∫sin(x)/x dx

Risch analysis:
  Cannot reduce to rational form in any elementary extension

Result: Not elementary
Actual: Si(x) + C  [Si is non-elementary]
```

**Logarithmic Integral**:
```
∫1/ln(x) dx

Risch analysis:
  Extension: t = ln(x), ∂t = 1/x
  RDE formulation fails to find elementary solution

Result: Not elementary
Actual: li(x) + C  [li is non-elementary]
```

**Elliptic Integral (First Kind)**:
```
∫1/sqrt(1-x^4) dx

Risch analysis:
  Algebraic extension (not yet implemented in MathHook)
  Even with algebraic extensions, provably non-elementary

Result: Not elementary
Actual: Elliptic integral F(x, 1/2) + C
```

### MathHook Behavior

When MathHook's Risch detects non-elementary:
```rust
# extern crate mathhook_book;
# use mathhook_book::mathhook;
# use mathhook::prelude::*;
let result = expr.integrate(x);

// Returns symbolic integral
assert!(matches!(result, Expression::Calculus(_)));
```

This indicates: "I tried everything, no elementary form exists."

---

## Limitations

MathHook's Risch implementation is **basic** and has limitations:

### Current Limitations

1. **Algebraic Extensions Not Implemented**
   ```
   ∫sqrt(x+1) dx  # Would need algebraic extension
   ```
   Workaround: Falls back to substitution heuristic

2. **Trigonometric Functions Converted to Exponentials**
   ```
   sin(x) = (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/(2i)  # Complex exponentials
   ```
   Limitation: Complex number handling incomplete

3. **Mixed Extensions Limited**
   ```
   ∫e^x*ln(x) dx  # Multiple extension types
   ```
   Limitation: Current implementation may fail

4. **Performance on Large Expressions**
   - O(n⁴) worst case complexity
   - Large polynomial degrees slow down factoring
   - Deep extension towers increase memory usage

5. **Non-Elementary Detection Incomplete**
   - May return `None` even when integral is elementary
   - Conservative: Avoids false positives but may have false negatives

### Comparison with SymPy

| Trigonometric | Via exponentials | Full |
| Non-elementary detection | Basic | Complete |
| Performance | Fast (Rust) | Moderate (Python) |
| Maturity | Basic (v1.0) | Production (15+ years) |

### Phase 1: Algebraic Extensions (v1.1)

```rust
# extern crate mathhook_book;
# use mathhook_book::mathhook;
# use mathhook::prelude::*;
pub enum Extension {
    Exponential(Expression),
    Logarithmic(Expression),
    Algebraic {                    // NEW
        expression: Expression,    // e.g., sqrt(x+1)
        minimal_polynomial: Expression, // e.g., t^2 - (x+1)
        degree: usize,
    },
}
```

# extern crate mathhook_book;
# use mathhook_book::mathhook;
# use mathhook::prelude::*;
∫e^(-x^2) dx → (√π/2)*erf(x) + C
∫sin(x)/x dx → Si(x) + C
∫1/ln(x) dx → li(x) + C
```

### Phase 4: Parallel Risch (v2.1)
