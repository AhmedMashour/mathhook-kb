        "# Symbolic Assumptions\n\nAssumptions allow you to declare mathematical properties about symbols\n(positive, real, integer, etc.) to guide MathHook's symbolic engine toward\nmore accurate simplifications and solutions.\n\n## Why Assumptions Matter\n\nWithout assumptions, MathHook treats all symbols as arbitrary complex numbers,\nleading to overly conservative results. With assumptions:\n- √(x²) can simplify to |x| (real assumption) or x (positive assumption)\n- Inequalities can be solved symbolically\n- Domain restrictions are enforced\n\n## Current Status\n\n**Planned Feature**: Full assumption system is under development.\n\n## Expected API (Future)\n\n```rust\nlet x = symbol!(x).assume_positive();\nlet y = symbol!(y).assume_real();\nlet n = symbol!(n).assume_integer();\n\nlet expr = expr!(sqrt(x^2));\n// With x > 0: simplifies to x\n// Without: stays as sqrt(x^2) or becomes |x|\n```\n\n## Assumption Types (Planned)\n\n- **Positivity**: x > 0, x ≥ 0, x < 0, x ≤ 0\n- **Reality**: x ∈ ℝ (real numbers)\n- **Integer**: n ∈ ℤ\n- **Rational**: q ∈ ℚ\n- **Natural**: n ∈ ℕ (positive integers)\n- **Finiteness**: x is finite (not infinity)\n- **Primality**: p is prime (for number theory)\n\n## Use Cases\n\n### Simplification\nWith assumptions, expressions simplify more aggressively:\n- √(x²) → x (if x > 0)\n- |x| → x (if x > 0)\n- x/x → 1 (if x ≠ 0)\n\n### Solving\nInequalities and conditional solutions:\n- Solve x² > 4 given x > 0 → x > 2\n- Solve log(x) = 2 → x = e² (with x > 0 automatic)\n\n### Integration\nDomain restrictions for improper integrals:\n- ∫₀^∞ e^(-ax) dx requires a > 0\n\n### Series Expansion\nConvergence conditions:\n- Taylor series valid for |x| < R\n\n## Relation to SymPy/SageMath\n\nMathHook's assumption system will follow similar patterns to SymPy's\n`assume()` API but integrated directly into the symbol creation macros.\n\n"
