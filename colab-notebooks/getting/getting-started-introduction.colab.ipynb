        "# Introduction\n\nWelcome to the MathHook documentation! MathHook is a high-performance educational computer algebra system (CAS) written in Rust, designed to combine mathematical correctness with exceptional performance.\n\n## What is MathHook?\n\nMathHook is a symbolic mathematics engine that can:\n\n- **Parse** mathematical expressions from multiple formats (LaTeX, Wolfram Language, standard notation)\n- **Simplify** algebraic expressions using canonical forms and mathematical identities\n- **Differentiate** and **integrate** expressions symbolically\n- **Solve** equations and systems of equations\n- **Manipulate** matrices with full linear algebra support\n- **Explain** mathematical operations step-by-step for educational purposes\n\n## Why MathHook?\n\n### Performance-First Design\n\nMathHook is built from the ground up for speed:\n\n- **32-byte expression representation** fits perfectly in CPU cache lines\n- **SIMD operations** for vectorized arithmetic (2-4x speedup)\n- **Zero-copy parsing** directly constructs AST without intermediate allocations\n- **Thread-safe immutable expressions** enable parallel processing\n- **10-100x faster** than SymPy for common operations\n\n### Mathematical Correctness\n\nEvery operation in MathHook is designed to be mathematically correct:\n\n- Exact rational arithmetic (never loses precision)\n- Proper domain handling (sqrt, log, division by zero)\n- Canonical forms for reliable equality checking\n- Validated against SymPy\n\n### Educational Focus\n\nMathHook provides step-by-step explanations for all mathematical operations, making it ideal for:\n\n- Educational software\n- Mathematics learning platforms\n- Interactive mathematics tools\n- Automated tutoring systems\n\n### Multi-Language Support\n\nMathHook provides first-class bindings for:\n\n- **Rust** (native API with ergonomic macros)\n- **Python** (via PyO3)\n- **Node.js/TypeScript** (via NAPI-RS)\n- **WebAssembly** (coming soon)\n\n## Key Features\n\n### Expression Building\n\nCreate mathematical expressions naturally using the `expr!` and `symbol!` macros.\n\n### Symbolic Computation\n\nPerform algebraic manipulations symbolically:\n- Simplification\n- Expansion\n- Factorization\n\n### Calculus Operations\n\nCompute derivatives and integrals symbolically.\n\n### Equation Solving\n\nSolve equations and systems of equations.\n\n### Matrix Operations\n\nFull linear algebra support with symbolic and numeric matrices.\n\n## Architecture\n\nMathHook is organized as a multi-crate workspace:\n\n- **mathhook-core**: Core mathematical engine (pure Rust)\n- **mathhook**: High-level API with ergonomic macros\n- **mathhook-python**: Python bindings\n- **mathhook-node**: Node.js/TypeScript bindings\n- **mathhook-benchmarks**: Performance benchmarking suite\n\n## Design Principles\n\nMathHook follows five core principles (in priority order):\n\n1. **Mathematical Correctness First**: Every operation must be mathematically correct\n2. **Performance**: Cache-friendly data structures, SIMD operations, parallel processing\n3. **Ergonomic API**: Macros and operator overloading for natural expression\n4. **Educational Value**: Step-by-step explanations for all operations\n5. **Multi-Language**: First-class bindings for Python, Node.js, and WebAssembly\n\n"
